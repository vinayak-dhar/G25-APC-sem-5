array -> it is a data structer
arrays -> it is an predefined class
when running a basic program -> there will be 1 main thread that will be used that java have

Array:
- array is fixed in size
- array is homogeneous
- doesn't have inbuild method

Collection:
- collection is dynamic in size
- collection is heterogeneous
- it have inbuilt methods

_______ multi threading / Synchronization _________

multi threading ->
 - using multiple thread and call them one by one -> synchronization
 - this will increase the time complexity
 - and data loss will not occur

________ ArrayList _________
arraylist ->
- it is a type of dynamic array
- not legacy collection
- heterogeneous
- follow insertion order
- can have duplicate
- by default arraylist will provide -> 10 size  -> and we want to insert elements after the CurrentCapacity is used-> (CurrentCapacity * 3/2 + 1)
- sorting change is not allowed
- not a synchronized method
- time complexity is reduced
- performance increases
- can have chances of data inconsistency


vector is a legacy collection
legacy collection -> Legacy collections are part of Java before the Java Collections Framework (JCF) was introduced in Java 1.2. These classes were later updated to implement the collection interfaces.


when to use arraylist and linkedlist ->
when we need for insertion and modification we will use linkedlist
when we need to access the data we will use arraylist


_________ vector ______________
- synchronized
- legacy collection

_________ stack ______________
-

_________ set ________________
